- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ndambra
-  Iâ€™m currently interested in learning how to create reactive, user-friendly, and quality looking web applications. I've been taking a deep dive into React and learning to create web applications with React and Redux, while also enhancing my JS, HTML, and CSS skills
-  My background is mainly in Java but I am always trying to branch out and learn new languages/concepts/frameworks/etc. (as in the case above with React)
